# Crop-Recommendation-System
## Description
The Crop Recomendation system is an end to end project which recommends by suggesting the most suitable crop for the given conditions. It aims and is motivated to help farmers in choosing the correct crop for their region.

This System takes into account several factors Nitrogen,Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall to determine the most suitable crop for the region,By analyzing historical data and using various classification models, the system provides recommendations for specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

## Key Features

Input Data Collection: The system allows users to input relevant data such as soil parameters and climate information. Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, KNearestNeighbor(KNN), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models. Model Training and Evaluation: The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability. Crop Recommendation: Based on the trained models, the system recommends the most suitable crops for the given input parameters. User-Friendly Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily input their data and view recommendations. 

## Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for model development, and web application development. Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction. Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis. NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests. HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing the web interface. JavaScript: Scripting language used for client-side interactions and enhancing the user interface.

## Future Enhancements

Integration of real-time weather data to improve the accuracy of recommendations. Incorporation of crop market prices and profitability analysis to assist farmers in making economically viable decisions. Development of a mobile application for convenient access and usage on smartphones and tablets. Integration of user feedback and data collection to continuously enhance the recommendation system's performance. Intregration with IOT devices to detect the parameters rom the soil and climate.
